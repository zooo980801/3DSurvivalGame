INSTALLATION
-------------
I. IMPORT TENKOKU FILES INTO YOUR PROJCT
Go to: 밃ssets -> Import Package -> Custom Package...?in the Unity Menu and select the 뱓enkoku_dynamicsky_ver1.x.unitypackage?file. This will open an import dialog box. Click the import button and all the Tenkoku files will be imported into your project list.

II. ADD THE TENKOKU MODULE TO YOUR SCENE
1) Drag the Tenkoku DynamicSky prefab located in the ?PREFABS?folder into your scene list.
2) If it isn뭪 set already, make sure to set the Tenkoku DynamicSky뭩 position in the transform settings to 0,0,0

III. ADD TENKOKU EFFECTS TO YOUR CAMERA
1) Click on your main camera object and add the Tenkoku Fog effect by going to Component-->Image Effects-->Tenkoku-->Tenkoku Fog.
Note: For best results this effect should be placed to render BEFORE your Tonemapping effect(if applicable).

(optional)
2) Click on your main camera object and add the Tenkoku Sun Shaft effect by going to Component-->Image Effects-->Tenkoku-->Tenkoku Sun Shafts.
Note: For best results this effect should be placed to render AFTER your Tonemapping effect(if applicable).


A Note About Scene Cameras:
Tenkoku relies on tracking your main scene camera in order to properly update in the scene.  By default Tenkoku attempts to auto locate your camera by selecting the camera in your scene with the 멝ainCamera?tag.  Alternatively you can set it to manual mode and drag the appropriate camera into the 멣cene Camera?slot.

NOTES
-------------
A Note On Accuracy:
Moon and planet position calculations are currently accurate for years ranging between 1900ce - 2100ce.  The further away from the year 2000ca that you get (in either direction) the more noticeable calculation errors will become.  Additional calculation methods are currently being looked at to increase the accuracy range for these objects.

Integration with CTS - Complete Terrain Shader:
CTS is an advanced terrain shader for Unity with built-in settings to control wetness, rain, snow, and seasonal tinting directly on the terrain itself.  Tenkoku provides an integration script which will automatically drive the effects in CTS according to the weather settings you use in Tenkoku.  To enable this integration, install CTS and Tenkoku in your project, add the CTS weather Manager, then finally drag the /SCRIPTS/Tenkoku_CTS_Weather component onto the 'CTS Weather Manager' object in your scene.

A note about SRP (Scriptable Render Pipeline) in Unity 2018+ 
-------------------------------------------------------------
(November 2019)
Many people have asked about the new SRP system in Unity 2018+.  Because Unity's new HDRP and URP(LWRP) Render Pipeline is still under active development, and because of the massive differences between these and the current default rendering system, I've decided to take a "wait and see approach" to when/if Tenkoku will support these modes.  Unfortunately the amount of work involved in upgrading to SRP is not trivial.  Once SRP is more mature I will take another look and reconsider if I will rewrite Tenkoku to support them.
